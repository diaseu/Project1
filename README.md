# Project1: OutIn

Application to search both local restaurant options (eat out) and recipes options (eat in).
People have wondered for the longest time whether they should eat out (dining out a restaurant) or eat in (cook and prepare their own food at home). Our site aims to solve that problem. Using our search feature, you can easily decide between eating in/out. Powered by Yelp and Spoonacular, a list of restaurants and recipes are readily available at your fingertips! Finally, no more dealing with the hard pressed decision of where to put food in your stomach and more time spent deliberating about other things, like finances!
